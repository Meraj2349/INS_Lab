This is a sample text file for hash function analysis.
We will test the avalanche effect of MD5 and SHA256 hash functions.
The avalanche effect means that a small change in input should produce
a dramatically different output hash value.
This property is crucial for cryptographic hash functions.
Information security is the practice of protecting information
by mitigating information risks and vulnerabilities.
